A game fully created by OpenAI's ChatGPT,using love2d as the platform, I am coding absolutely nothing and this is only created by the AI with me asking it to add or remove things etc. Created this out of pure curiosity on chatGPT.

also there's no guarentee this codes works, i don't debug, i tell the AI the issue and we hash it out that way... however long it takes.




This version of the code introduces new game mechanics, including:

Power-ups: The game now includes power-ups that can be collected by the player. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increased speed or extra lives.

Extended gameplay: The game now has a menu with options to start the game, view instructions, or quit. This adds replayability and allows players to access different parts of the game.

Multiple enemies and power-ups: The game can now spawn multiple enemies and power-ups simultaneously, increasing the challenge and variety in gameplay.

Menu navigation: Players can use keyboard or mouse input to navigate the menu options and select different actions.

These additional mechanics enhance the replayability and length of the game by adding new gameplay elements, goals, and strategic choices for the players. Feel free to customize and adjust the code further to suit your specific game design preferences.
