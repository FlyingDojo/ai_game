A game fully created by OpenAI's ChatGPT, using love2d as the platform, I am coding absolutely nothing and this is only created by the AI with me asking it to add or make it better in some way, e.g. can you make it more OOP, what do you recommend to make this more fun? etc.  Created this out of pure curiosity on chatGPT.

Also there's no guarantee this codes works all the time, I try to minimise my debugging but sometimes I need to lead the AI down the right path to fix the bug or we will go round in circles.



-----------------
This version of the code introduces new game mechanics, including:

Power-ups: The game now includes power-ups that can be collected by the player. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increased speed or extra lives.

Extended gameplay: The game now has a menu with options to start the game, view instructions, or quit. This adds replay-ability and allows players to access different parts of the game.

Multiple enemies and power-ups: The game can now spawn multiple enemies and power-ups simultaneously, increasing the challenge and variety in gameplay.

Menu navigation: Players can use keyboard or mouse input to navigate the menu options and select different actions.

These additional mechanics enhance the replay-ability and length of the game by adding new gameplay elements, goals, and strategic choices for the players. Feel free to customise and adjust the code further to suit your specific game design preferences.
